jnetpcap-1.4.r1500 is our custom build which adds a correction to the jnetpcap library which does not parse packets properly if they have TCP Segmentation Offload (the ip length is set to 0 in the header, and the rest of the packet does not get correctly decoded). This causes flows to have src and dst ports to be 0. The libraries have not been tested in all possible environments, so if there are any issues with it, revert back to jnetpcap-1.4.r1425 versions in the build.gradle scripts, when running the tool.
